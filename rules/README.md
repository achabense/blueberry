#### About these rules

The rules in [old/](https://github.com/achabense/blueberry/tree/main/rules/old) (`ro4 xx.txt` and `sym xx.txt`) were collected in 2021, selected from many random rules that were generated by a much simpler program (a never-published obsolete version of this project). Many of them are not interesting enough tbh, but there are some exceptions, for example the following one (in `ro4 b.txt`):

The rules in this folder (`rulexx.txt`) were collected during the development of this project. Some comments in the files may be outdated (and ignorable) as they refer to features in the earlier versions of this program (which have been removed or heavily redesigned).

To test these rules in the program, you may either download the files and open them in `Files`, or copy some rules to the clipboard and `Read` in `Clipboard`.
